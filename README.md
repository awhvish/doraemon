🎓 **AI-Powered Learning Assistant for Dyslexic Students**

This platform helps dyslexic students by using AI to track their eye movements and blinking patterns during lectures. If a student struggles to focus, the system records those moments and analyzes them to provide better learning support.

🔥 **How It Works**

👀 Eye-Tracking with AI – Detects when a student is losing focus using OpenCV and PyTorch.

⏳ Smart Timestamping – Marks parts of the lecture where the student faced difficulties.

📊 Weighted Graph Analysis – Maps attention drops to highlight tricky sections.

📝 Auto-Generated Notes – Creates summaries for the moments a student missed.

🎨 Dyslexia-Friendly Design – A clean, accessible UI to improve the learning experience.

👩‍🏫 Teacher Insights – Helps educators understand which topics need better explanation.


🛠 **Tech Stack**

Frontend: Next.js (React)

Backend: Flask (Python)

AI Models: OpenCV, PyTorch


This isn’t just a note-taking tool—it’s a smarter way to help both students and teachers understand learning patterns and make education more inclusive. 🚀
